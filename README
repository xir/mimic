Neuroscience Project to generate sentences based on the word-pair
frequencies in a sample and analyse the generated sentence by calculating
the mean and variance of the inter-word intervals.

in src/

  make

to make, and

  ./mimic n [filename]

to generate words looking at the previous n words. The filename is optional,
default is 'Example.txt'. It will use a lot of memory if you start to look
at large numbers of previous words, ie. previous 1000 words of a 20k words
sample. If n is out of range it reverts to 1, if it is not a number it
reverts to 0.

The user is then prompted if they want to print the sentence and which words
they would like to view information about. This can be used to compare
english text with generated text of different complexities.

The default maximum sentence length is 100001, if the program doesn't have
any frequency data before this length it will terminate. This can happen
because we have no data about what word will follow the final word in the
input *if* it is its first occurence (looking at one previous word). This is
much more likely to happen looking at multiple words, if you look at enough
words in a row when generating the next word you can/will get stuck on a 
path to the end of the file. There seemed like no way to resolve this and
maintain the proper frequencies.
